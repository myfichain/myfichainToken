# myfichainToken

MyfiChain Token (MYFI) is a low volatility smart contract concept ethereum network (ERC-20). MyFi Tokens would serve as the new method of internet access payment.

As time goes, this project would replace the use of credit card in internet data subscription and access. The MyFiWallet would be launched very soon.


MyFiChain (MYFI) is an opensource project where ideas and feedback from the community members are actively implemented & tested. Join the discussions today on our telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/FThJxkVVjPxJxRVWLK0aMg
